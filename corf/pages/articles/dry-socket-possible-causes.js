                  <h3>Dry Socket- Possible Causes, Symptoms and Management</h3>

                  <p>
                    A dry socket, also known as “Alveolar osteitis” is one of
                    the commonest post-extraction complications. It is a painful
                    condition and the patient will be complaining of foul taste.
                    One of the characteristic features of this condition is the
                    peculiar smell from the patient’s mouth. It occurs, usually
                    after the 3rd or 4th postoperative day andrequires
                    professional intervention for the management and also to
                    rule out some other possible conditions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Simple intra-alveolar extraction of a tooth is considered as
                    the simplest of oral surgical procedures and most
                    frequently, has an uneventful recovery as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, everyone is not that lucky to go through this
                    procedure without any complications. These complications can
                    be categorized as
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Pre-operative</b> – issues relating to medical conditions
                    or anatomy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Intra-operative</b> – those that occur during the
                    procedure. <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Post-operative</b> – those that occur following the
                    procedure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Postoperative complications are further classified as
                    immediate postoperative and delayed postoperative
                    complications. Furthermore, complications are also
                    classified based upon the location (local or distant),
                    severity (minor or major), and type (general extraction
                    complication or specific to a certain tooth).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To minimize the risk of developing any type of complication
                    related to tooth extraction, one needs a proper evaluation
                    of the patient preoperatively. Thisncludes medical history,
                    drug history( including over the counter medicines), social
                    history (such smoking and alcohol consumption) as these all
                    can contribute towards delayed healing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Certain habits can make one susceptible to develop a dry
                    socket. Though the etiology is variable and not completely
                    understood, Some factors known to increase the risk include
                    smoking, and failure to comply with post-operative
                    instructions. Many authors also suggest that teeth which
                    have had multiple episodes of recurrent pericoronitis are
                    prone to develop alveolar osteitis postoperatively. Lower
                    Third molars are notoriously known to develop this
                    complication. Some reports also pointed that poor oral
                    hygiene plays a significant role in the risk of having a dry
                    socket post-operatively. A few reports also pointed that
                    females are more prone to developing a dry socket than
                    males.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the tooth extraction, just like when one gets injured
                    on any other part of their body, the site of the extraction
                    fills with blood and forms a blood clot. A dry socket
                    develops when this all-important blood clot gets detached or
                    lost from the healing socket before the wound has healed,
                    leaving the underlying bone dry and exposed. This is where
                    the concept of a dry socket comes from, as the socket is
                    void of blood and looks denuded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prevention is always better than cure and we have to strive
                    to do our best to mitigate the risk of complications.
                    Studies have shown that using Chlorhexidine Mouth Washe a
                    few days before a planned third molar surgery is an
                    effective way to minimize the incidence of a dry-socket.
                    Systemic antibiotics significantly reduce the risk of dry
                    socket and infection in third molar extraction. Management
                    of pericoronitis efficiently when it occurs and extract the
                    tooth after pericoronitis subsides also helps in minimizing
                    the risk of developing a dry socket.. Patients who do not
                    refrain from smoking a day or two before and after
                    extraction, have more chances of developing this
                    complication.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Post extraction instructions should be clear and
                    shouldinclude, avoidance of any strenuous activity as this
                    would increase the blood pressure and risk detaching the
                    clot. One would also need to avoid eating any hot foods as
                    this may cause a new bleed and that may dislodge the clot.
                    Therefore (lukewarm), soft foods will keep that clot in
                    place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Emphasis on the importance of not smoking for at least 48
                    hours, as tobacco use would delay the healing process and
                    may increase the risk of complications. Smoking restricts
                    the blood supply to the extraction site and some authors
                    advise to refrain from smoking for 6 weeks or so
                    post-extraction.Last but not least, 24 hours after the
                    extraction, gentle rise of the mouth with lukewarm saltwater
                    as many times a day as possible for about five days. If any
                    undue pain after 2 to 3 days occurs, report to the dentist
                    immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once patient reports for the pain on 3rd to 5th day
                    postoperatively, few investigations should be performed to
                    rule out local pathologies
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A complete extraoral and intraoral examination is required
                    to rule out any local pathology or some other source of
                    pain. It could be pain from a foreign body in the extraction
                    siteA radiograph is required to identify if there is a
                    residual root tip or a bony fragment within the socket. If
                    trismus (limited mouth opening) is present it may be caused
                    by some general inflammation of the mucosa, extraction site
                    or may be due to a local anesthesia needle injury to a
                    muscle. There could also be an infection at the extraction
                    site. Osteomyelitis may occur, however, not a frequent
                    occurrence. Pain may originate from an adjacent tooth having
                    a pulpal or periodontal pathology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the signs of a dry socket may include denuded bone
                    and inflamed mucosa at the site of extraction. Usually,
                    there is no facial swelling or regional lymph node
                    involvement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The treatment of dry socket would entail Irrigation of the
                    the site with chlorhexidine or saline to remove any food
                    debris. NEVER CURRETTE THE SOCKET TO INDUCE BLEEDING as this
                    may progress into osteomyelitis.. Pain may be controlled by
                    placing a sedative dressing material like Alvogyl or any
                    similar material and theextraction site should be covered by
                    a resorbable or non-resorbable dressing. Emphasis on
                    maintainance of good oral hygiene is of paramount
                    importance. Nonresorbable dressings should be removed after
                    48 -72 hours. If patient is still in pain, another sedative
                    dressing is placed in the area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Systemic analgesics should be prescribed as well to control
                    the pain. Either Tylenol 3 or an NSAID is a good choice
                    depending on the medical history of the patient.. REMEMBER:
                    This is not an infection but inflammation of the bone and
                    thereforesystemic antibiotics should not be prescribed.
                  </p>

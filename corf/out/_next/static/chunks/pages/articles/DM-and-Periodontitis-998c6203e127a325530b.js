The gums support your teeth above the bone. Therefore, the infection from plaque and tartar spreads from your gums to your bones. You have severe tartar and plaque around all your teeth. They are sitting around the necks of your teeth and have infected the gums and bones. This must have started many years ago and had slowly infected and destroyed the bones surrounding your teeth. This is called \u201cPeriodontitis\u201d. Therefore, there is no adequate bone support, and your teeth are only standing with the support of the tartar (calculus). In order to reduce the infection, I have to first remove the tartar. This will lead to your teeth shaking more as the support tartar was providing will no more be present. However, if we have to stop the infection and save your teeth from falling, we need to remove the source of infection, which is plaque and tartar and let the bones and gums heal."),m("p",null,"2. An individual who has diabetes has a slower healing response in gums and bone in presence of plaque and tartar. Therefore, as you have diabetes there is a higher chance that your gums are inflamed from a very long time and the capacity to reduce inflammation and initiate healing is compromised. This had led to a cascade of destructive events spreading the infection to the gums and bones of all teeth. The level of bone has reduced; therefore, the support has reduced and the teeth are shaking."),m("p",null,"Patient: Thank you doctor, for all this information. I was not aware of these details.
